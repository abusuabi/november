    <h1>NOVEMBER 12TH STUDIES</h1>
    <h2> A look at the things i have learnt over the past few days</h2>
    <p>This page is to go through all the things i have learnt over the past week</p>
    <p>Since i began this lesson to study coding and html. As the new phase to go into</p>
    <p>These revisions are my attempt at remebering what i have learnt. So waht i do is retype and create a whole new document without watching the videos</p>
    <p>Trying to remeber exactly what the new <strong>elemtns</strong> are which i have learnt over the week</p>
    <hr size= '4' colour= #1234>
    <h3>THINGS TO LEARN OR REVISE TODAY</h3>
    <br>
    <p>So for today's revision i am looking at revising the following</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Headings</li>
      <li>paragraphs</li>
      <li>Line breaks</li>
      <li>links</li>
      <li>lists</li>
      <li>images</li>
      <li>tables</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>HEADINGS</h3>
      <hr colour= #7777 size= '3'>
      <p>The first thing about headings is that we have up to six headings level these are</p>
      <ol>
        <li>H1 Which is the biggest</li>
        <li>H2 which is the second biggest </li>
        <li>H3 which is the third biggest</li>
        <li>H4 up until H6 which is the last biggest</li>
      </ol>
  <hr>
  <h4>PARAGRAPHS</h4>
  <p>paragraphs are that within which you write all you want to write and used to moved text from one line to the other</p>
  <p>like this without leaving space underneath the first line</p>
  <p>its quiet simple and yet also one of the most used elements in html. That is <em>if you have a lot of text writings</em></p>
  <hr>
  <h4>LINE BREAKS</h4>
  <p>this is used to place a line between two sections of your page layout. A very simple one. </p>
  <p>One thing to alos consider is that, some of the elements have other <strong>attributes</strong>. These are added values you can add to the element.</p>
  <p>the second thing to also consider is that, we have two different types of elements. These are</p>
  <ol type= 'i'>
    <li>Closed Elemets</li>
    <li>Unclosed Elemets</li>
    <p>Closed Elements are those that need a closing of the element with the <strong>/</strong><em>symbol</em> at the end of thecontent</p>
    <p>Unclosedor Open Elements are thos that appear only once and do not need any closure</p>
  </ol>
  <br>
  <h4>LINKS</h4>
  <p>Links are what enables you to connect from one part of the site to the other. They allow you to <em>reference</em>other documents, places and even locations outside your website. We shall try a few below</p>
  <p>So to try the links, i am going to create three different link types</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Link to a place on the page</li>
    <li>Link to a different page on this site</li>
    <li>Link to an external website</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Frankly i do not have an idea of how to link to a place on this same page. But will try and see.</p>
    <p>to do any link you use what they call the anchor emelemt and its an <strong>a</strong></p>
    <p> <a href="<h4>LINE BREAKS</h4>">Line Beak Heading</a></p>

    <br>
    <h4>IMAGES</h4>
    <p>The images element is what allows you to add images to your document. You can add an image from your own database or you can add from a website somewhere.</p>
    <p>In this instance again, i will work on both approaches. One using an image in my databse and the other allowing the image to pickit from another website</p>

    <br>
<hr>
<h4>TABLES</h4>
<p>Now this is the one that is most exciting for now;<strong><em>tables</em></strong></p>
<p>You can use the table element for different things aside just the table creation. You can use it also to position some text and images</p>
<p>So as usual, we will try both of the two options and see. The first is just creating a table with information and the second is postioing an image nad text side by side using the table element</p>
<p><em>Lets Go</em></p>

I have gone through all the lessons i have learnt so far. I am going to save <br>this and take a look at my work in a web browser. If it is as i have in mind praise God, Work Works and if you set your mind to something, by God's Help and  <br>hard or smart work and repetations or perserverance, you will achieve it.
So, lets take a peek at what we have done.
<h1>FORMS</h1>
<p>I am going to create or study forms now</p>
<form class="" action="<a href="mailto:josephnarnor@gmail.com method="post" enctype="text/plain">
<label for="YOUR NAME">Your Name</label>
<input type="text" name="Your Name" value=""><br>
